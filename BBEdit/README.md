# Spacedust for BBEdit

Installation:

1. Put `Spacedust.bbColorScheme` in BBEdit's "Color Schemes" support folder. (You can get there by choosing the folder name from the "Folders" submenu on the BBEdit application menu.)
2. Select it in the "Text Colors" preference pane.

It's recommended that you select the dark application appearance to match. BBEdit will let you choose separate dark and light color schemes and switch between them automatically with the system.
