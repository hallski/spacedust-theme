This is the Spacedust color theme repository.



Initially it was a color theme I created for Xcode and looks like this:

After you've checked out the repository, be sure to execute:
`git submodule update --init` 

Currently versions exists for:

* Xcode (by Mikael Hallendal)
* AppCode (by Mikael Hallendal)
* Terminal.app (by Cameron Spickert)
* iTerm 2 (by Luís Couto)
* Coda 2 (by Luís Couto)
* TextMate/Sublime Text 2 (by Cormac Relf)

If you've made another version of it, please fork this project and send me a pull request.
